Personality Classification System (PCS)

Overview:
The Personality Classification System (PCS) is a comprehensive project developed to classify individuals as introverts or extroverts based on their speech patterns. Utilizing a diverse set of programming tools and advanced algorithms, PCS integrates frontend and backend technologies to create an efficient and accurate personality classification system.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: PHP

Algorithm Implementation: Python

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Project Description:

The PCS project was designed to analyze speech patterns and automatically classify individuals into introverted or extroverted personality types. The system utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for developing a user-friendly interface. PHP is employed to handle backend functionalities, while Python is used to implement sophisticated algorithms that analyze key features of speech, such as pitch, tone, and speaking rate.

General Functionalities:

Speech Pattern Analysis: The core functionality of PCS involves the systematic analysis of speech to identify personality traits.
Advanced Algorithms: The system incorporates machine learning techniques to analyze speech features and classify personalities accurately.
Automated Classification: By processing extensive datasets of recorded speech, PCS provides reliable and nuanced personality classifications.
Contribution to Research: The project aims to enhance the field of personality analysis by offering a tool that automates and refines the process of classifying individuals based on their spoken language characteristics.

Outcome:

The PCS project successfully delivers a sophisticated tool that contributes to personality research by providing precise and automated classifications of individuals as introverts or extroverts. The system's integration of diverse programming tools and advanced algorithms ensures a comprehensive approach to understanding how speech reflects personality traits.
